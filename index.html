<p>I spent two months working as a congressional intern for senator Isakson. This internship had a major impact on my life. The internship, help me to realize what I want to do when I finish up with college. Which is to become a staffer and work my way up the chain, and when I get burned out then switch over to lobbying. With that being said, I was also very fortunate to be able to make a variety of connections throughout my time in DC.</p>
<p>Throughout my time in D.C. I had a great deal of opportunity to meet a variety of people. These people were Democratic and Republican Leaderships. A variety of staffers regardless of political party, and got to meet several lobbyist and think tank people. The one thing I notice was the friendship that was apparent between everyone.</p> 
<p>The friendship between everybody was obvious from the beginning. These friendships were across party lines. This was due to the fact that every Wednesday the whole entire capitol would break up into teams based off of states and go play a game of softball. After the game, everyone would go to the local bar <i>union Pub</i> and have a drink.</p>
<p> Throughout every week we as an office would do several activities outside of the office
